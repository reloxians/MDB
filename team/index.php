<div class="dev_details">

Jennifer Montrose is RS - Developer's expert in Getting Things Done. She's been managing our executive team since 2017, ensuring that they're focused, efficient, and serving our employees well. With two fairly useless (but fascinating!) degrees in art history and film studies, Jennifer had been an executive assistant for her entire career before she became Deputy Chief of Staff. She joined the tech industry by happenstance when she applied to RS - Developers because it was listed 15th in Crain's "Best Place to Work in NYC". She spends her extra time advocating for RS - Developers to become the most inclusive place for developers to ethically shape the future. She's an amateur cook, avid documentary viewer, and a lively conversationalist. She plans to spend the rest of her life in Brooklyn.
