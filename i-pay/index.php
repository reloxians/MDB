<span class="email">15%</span> of <span class="email"> ₦2800</span> is <span class="email">₦420</span> and resultantly, the total charged fee is now <span class="email"> ₦3220</span>

Balance of the total charged fee must be paid before the delivery of the service to the customer who placed 
the order.
